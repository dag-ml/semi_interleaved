# Semi Interleaved HITON PC
## Project overview:
"This research builds upon a previous study, "Validating Causal Diagrams of Human Health Risks for Spaceflight: An Example Using Bone Data from Rodents," 
conducted last year by scientists including Robert Reynolds, Ryan Scott, and Lauren Sanders [11]. The primary objective of our experiment was to explore 
the feasibility of leveraging pre-existing Bayesian structure learning algorithms to replicate the causal diagrams generated in the aforementioned study. 
The focus of the original research was the investigation of Human Health Risks for Spaceflight, specifically pertaining to the causes of diminished bone
strength due to gravitational changes. To achieve this, datasets from four distinct experiments — Dubeé (2014), Keune (2015), Keune (2016), Ko (2020 pt. 1), 
and Ko (2020 pt. 2) — were utilized. However, as the research progressed, the emphasis shifted from merely replicating these specific Directed Acyclic 
Graphs (DAGs) to a broader inquiry: the potential of creating Bayesian network structures that accurately depict causal relationships validated by domain 
experts. This journey revealed challenges stemming from data quality and the inherent limitations of working with small datasets. As a result, the study 
concludes by acknowledging the current constraints in obtaining algorithms to perform optimally with small datasets and suggests avenues for future research. 
These include exploring larger datasets and refining algorithm parameterization methods to enhance the learning of causal relations."
