Study Title	Spaceflight-induced (STS-62) vertebral bone loss in ovariectomized rats is associated with increased bone marrow adiposity and no change in bone formation
Study Description	There is often a reciprocal relationship between bone marrow adipocytes and osteoblasts, suggesting that marrow adipose tissue (MAT) antagonizes osteoblast differentiation. MAT is increased in rodents during spaceflight but a causal relationship between MAT and bone loss remains unclear. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of a 14-day spaceflight on bone mass, bone resorption, bone formation, and MAT in lumbar vertebrae of ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Twelve-week-old OVX Fischer 344 rats were randomly assigned to a ground control or flight group. Following flight, histological sections of the second lumbar vertebrae (n equals 11/group) were stained using a technique that allowed simultaneous quantification of cells and preflight fluorochrome label. Compared with ground controls, rats flown in space had 32% lower cancellous bone area and 306% higher MAT. The increased adiposity was due to an increase in adipocyte number (224%) and size (26%). Mineral apposition rate and osteoblast turnover were unchanged during spaceflight. In contrast, resorption of a preflight fluorochrome and osteoclast-lined bone perimeter were increased (16% and 229%, respectively). The present findings indicate that cancellous bone loss in rat lumbar vertebrae during spaceflight is accompanied by increased bone resorption and MAT but no change in bone formation. These findings do not support the hypothesis that increased MAT during spaceflight reduces osteoblast activity or lifespan. However, in the context of ovarian hormone deficiency, bone formation during spaceflight was insufficient to balance increased resorption, indicating defective coupling. The results are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that during spaceflight mesenchymal stem cells are diverted to adipocytes at the expense of forming osteoblasts. This dataset derives results from the bone histomorphometry assay.

Study Protocol Description	Flight animals were sacrificed 4-6 hours after landing. Additional ground-based ovary-intact rats (n equals 18) were evaluated. The ovary-intact animals represent reserve rats to be used if the originally planned flight had been delayed. Since the mission was carried out as anticipated, these animals were maintained in a vivarium and sacrificed to provide age-matched reference values for baseline (n equals 8, 12 weeks old) and flight (n equals 10, 14 weeks old). The purpose of the ovary-intact controls was 2-fold: 1) to evaluate normal age-related changes in bone over the 2 week flight period, and 2) to verify that ovariectomies (OVX) resulted in anticipated cancellous osteopenia. This dataset is only the data from OVX animals. All rats were sacrificed by decapitation and bones were harvested and placed in 70% ethanol for analysis.	"Second lumbar vertebrae from 11 rats per group were available for evaluation. The bones were prepared for histological analysis as described. In brief, specimens were dehydrated in increased concentrations of ethanol and embedded in a mixture of methyl methacrylate and 2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate (in a 12.5:1 ratio). Five-micrometer-thin sections were then cut on a microtome (model 2065, Reichert-Jung, Heidelberg, Germany) and stained with toluidine blue (Sigma Chemical, St Louis, MO, USA). The staining technique allowed simultaneous quantification of cells and fluorochrome label.

The effects of spaceflight on bone resorption and osteoblast turnover were evaluated using a novel approach. Specifically, the preflight fluorochrome label was used to identify bone perimeter undergoing mineralization in preflight animals experiencing normal weight bearing. Because preflight fluorochrome label perimeter is assumed to be similar in the rats randomly assigned to a group (ground control or flight), post-flight differences in label length represent intergroup differences in bone resorption during flight. In turn, the perimeter bounded by preflight label with adjacent osteoblasts represents continuous bone formation throughout the duration of flight, whereas fluorochrome label with no adjacent osteoblasts reflects sites undergoing bone mineralization at the time of label administration but not subsequently (ceased bone formation). In contrast, bone perimeter bounded by osteoblasts with no adjacent label represents sites where bone formation was newly initiated during flight (i.e., following administration of the preflight label). Cell and fluorochrome data were simultaneously collected by viewing the sections under combined visible light and ultraviolet light using the OsteoMeasure System (OsteoMetrics, Atlanta, GA, USA). Endpoints evaluated included bone area fraction (bone area/tissue area, area of total
tissue evaluated occupied by cancellous bone, %), fluorochrome label length (length/tissue area, mm/mm2) and osteoclast perimeter (osteoclast
perimeter/bone perimeter, %). Fluorochrome-based indices of bone formation included measurements of continuous bone formation during
flight (percentage of bone lined with osteoblasts associated with the single label; %), ceased bone formation during flight (percentage of bone
perimeter with label not associated with osteoblasts, %), newly initiated bone formation during flight (percentage of osteoblast perimeter not
associated with label, %) and mineral apposition rate (mean distance between the fluorochrome marker and osteoblast-lined perimeter divided
by number of days between the label injection and killing (15 days), μm/day). MAT (% tissue area) and adipocyte number ( /mm2) were measured and adipocyte size (μm2) was determined by dividing MAT by adipocyte number."	To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a bone histomorphometry data reuse template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures/parameters). This enables all histomorphometry results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.	Twelve-week-old female Fischer 344 rats (Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY) were used in the study. The animals were maintained in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the experimental protocol was approved by the NASA and Mayo Clinic Animal Care and Use Committees. The rats were ovx 14 days prior to launch and randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: 1) ground-based flight control (ground control, n equals 12), or 2) spaceflight (flight, n equals 12). The flight animals were flown on the Space Shuttle Columbia (STS-62) for 14 days. Flight and ground control animals were housed in animal enclosure modules (AEM) with 6 rats/AEM. The AEMs were maintained at 28 °C. All animals were provided with food (Teklad L356 food bars; Teklad Inc., Madison, WI) and water ad libitum.
