STUDY
Study Identifier	OSD-489
Study Title	Quantifying Cancellous Bone Structural Changes in Microgravity: Axial Skeleton Results from the RR-1 Mission
Study Description	Objective of this study was to further validate bone degradation in microgravity as site-specific and preferential to weight bearing bone. An objective of this study was to further understand the role of the mechanical environment in controlling the process of bone remodeling, namely local formation and resorption to maintain a healthy structure. These data from the lumbar 4 bones of Rodent Research-1 mission aboard the International Space Station, are unpublished, and were presented at the 2016 meeting of the American Society for Gravitational Space Research. This dataset derives results from the micro–computed tomography (mCT) assay.

Study Protocol Description	The RR-1 mice were euthanized by ISS crew with Euthasol injection followed by cervical dislocation, frozen in a pre-chilled Mini Cold Bag (MCB) before transfer to the MELFI freezer (-80 C) and brought back to Earth. Exact matched procedures were held for ground control, vivarium, and basal groups. After vehicle return, dissection of all four groups (flight, baseline, ground, vivarium) were conducted. The returned carcasses were thawed and dissected twice. The first round of carcass dissections, known as the RR1 1st thaw BSP (Biospecimen Sharing Program), spanned a 2-week period in April 2015 and a 1-week period in May 2015. The RR1 2nd thaw BSP was performed in March 2016. BSP samples were dissected, frozen, and then transferred to the Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA; now NBISC [NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection) for long-term storage. Tissues from forty mice were received for this study, from RR-1 through BSP/ALSDA and lumbar vertebrae (L4) were assessed for cancellous bone by microcomputed tomography. Vertebrae were preserved by wrapping specimens with single 2-ply gauze squares (1/3 of a typical tri-fold gauze pad) and dipped into PBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+. Tissues were stored in labeled specimen containers and placed on ice, and subsequently stored at -20C.	The mCT machine used for this study was a SkyScan 1174, Bruker, Belgium. The scanning was conducted at 6.7 micrometers per pixel, x-ray intensity was 800 miliamperes, and killivolt peak was 50kvp, with frame averaging of 2. A .log file from the scanning, reconstruction, and analysis from this mCT study was submitted and available for data provenance.	This study was approved by by the NASA Ames Research Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Post-pubescent female C57BL/6J mice (16 weeks at launch) were exposed to 37 days of microG flight, after being flown to the ISS, and housed in the Rodent Habitat. Mice of similar age, sex and strain were used for ground controls housed in identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. The mice were acclimated to NASA Rodent Food bars, lixits, and wire floors.	To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a microCT data reuse template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all microCT results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.	An upper/lower threshold approach was used to binarize grayscale images, with a lower gray threshold of 40 and upper gray threshold of 255 (on 0-1000 scale).	The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation.
